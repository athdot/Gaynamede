TerraTex - Joe Patrick
------------
TerraTex is a simple to use terrain texturing tool I created for fun and am now sharing.
You are free to use it in any and all of your projects without giving any credit etc.

A demo scene is included as well as the full documentation.
As Standard Assets cannot be included in releases I have had to replace the 'Water' object from using the 'Water' standard asset to simply a textured plane
though I would recommend you use either one of the water standard assets or your own water shaders/scripts that you prefer.

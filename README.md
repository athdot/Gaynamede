# Gaynamede
*"We are all in the perpetual quest for keeping oneself occupied, entertained, and important—which burns at the edge of addiction."*

– Spike Spiegel

## Introduction
Gaynamede is a program made to procedurally generate terrain, in a psuedo-realistic way. Terrain modifications are simulated via artificial asteroid strikes, tectonics, and erosion on a 3 dimensional surface, in order to simulate a world similar to our own.

As it stands, Gaynamede is only capable of creating single tiles of terrain—as an incomplete package, but in the future modifications section, further requirements are listed.

## Package Layout
This program uses Unity 3D to run. At present, the files are current with editor version _______. Within the Assets folder there are several elements, which can be navigated by name. Of note, there is the Terrain Generation folders, which contain the majority of the code required to create terrain.

## Modifications
### Current Features
- Seeded World Generation (Both Random and Not)
- Asteroids (Simple and Complex)
- Correct Positioning, in regards to expanding tiles beyond original setup
- Smoothing

### Future Implementations
- Procedural infinite generation, with possibility of world borders
- Sand-dunes style starting canvas (Perhaps based on Perlin Noise)
- Separate generation threads, so one can watch the terrain generate in real-time
- Erosion (Glacial, Water, Wind etc...)
- Tectonics (Mountains, Sea plates)
- (As a subset of tectonics) Volcanics
- Material distribution within the world
- Riverbeds
- Material Rendering
